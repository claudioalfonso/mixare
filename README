Broken:

- Fix Othershape (Triangle) and paintPath, or replace them with a 3D model.
- !! EGL context is lost onPause (setPreserveEGLContext doesnt do his job)

Partially Broken:

- Zoombar does work, but not correct
- Create a decent layout for text on screen
- Better error handling.
- The webview doesnt work for panoramio and OSM (sometimes). Not caused by 3d tho ;-)

Anything else:

- Memory leak somewhere (probably caused by openGL) results in a SIGSEGV after a while.
- The bounding boxes used by touchevents should be tweaked further (maybe bigger, wider, etc.)
