Broken:

- Fix navigation markers (arrow)
- onResume creates a new paintscreen, but this is paintscreen is never shown

Partially Broken:

- Zoombar does work, but not correct
- Create a decent layout for text on screen
- Better error handling.
- The webview doesnt work for panoramio and OSM (sometimes). Not caused by 3d tho ;-)
- !! EGL context is lost onPause (setPreserveEGLContext doesnt do his job), fixed by clearing drawing buffers. 

Anything else:

- Draw stuff in 2D if 3D is disabled
- Memory leak somewhere (probably caused by openGL) results in a SIGSEGV after a while.
- The bounding boxes used by touchevents should be tweaked further (maybe bigger, wider, etc.)
